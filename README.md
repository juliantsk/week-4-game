# week-4-game

This is a Star Wars themed small RPG game with four characters from the Star Wars universe. A player picks their hero from four character options, then their opponent from the remaining three. Battle is accomplished through a single attack button that causes both the hero and opponent to attack. You lose when your hero has no health remaining. You win when you have taken all of the health of the other three characters.
